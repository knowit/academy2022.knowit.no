Kurset vil foregå på engelsk:

Design thinking is a practical, human-centered, and prototype-driven methodology for innovation. It helps teams of diverse people tackle fuzzy, ill-defined challenges in creative ways. These challenges can come in many shapes and sizes, for example, the development of new products, services, and experiences; the design of business models; or the shaping of organizational culture.
